  <blockquote>
    <p>
      It details how the project itself works, not how to write code in it. If
      you would like to know how to write code in Spindle, please look at the
      user documentation!
      <br />
      With that out of the way, this document will lay out how Spindle works
      and will help you contribute to it. <br />

    From Meaning to a Result: The Interpreter
  </h2>
  <p>
    The Lexer turns your list of tokens into something called an Abstract
    Syntax Tree (AST).
  </p>
  <p>
    An AST is a tree-like data structure that represents the syntactic
    structure of source code written in a formal language, most commonly
    programming languages. It&#39;s a crucial intermediate representation used
    by compilers and interpreters to analyze, transform, and optimize code.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Key Characteristics of an AST:</strong></p>
  <p>
    Hierarchical Structure: An AST is a tree, meaning it has a root node and
    branches that extend downward. Each node represents a specific syntactic
    construct in the source code. Abstractness: Unlike a token list, an AST
    doesn&#39;t represent every syntactic detail of the source code. It
    focuses on the essential structure and meaning of the code, abstracting
    away irrelevant details like parentheses and operator precedence. <br />
  </p>

  <hr />
  <p>
    The interpreter navigates this abstract syntax tree, actually running the
    program. For example, the lexer just tells the interpreter there&#39;s a for
    loop, how many times it needs to repeat, and the code inside of it to
    repeat. But the Interpreter is actually what runs that for loop to produce a
    result. Errors at this stage typically indicate a
    <strong><strong>critical</strong></strong> language bug that needs to be
    fixed immediately. Once it is finished, the interpreter will return the
    result of the program. If the program runs successfully but does not
    intentionally return anything, it returns null. This null value will get
    filtered out by the <code>shell.py</code> file when it displays your result.
