  <h2 id="allAboutTheSemiParser">All about the Semi-Parser</h2>
    <p>
      When you write code on using the spindle, you are told to run it though the
      <code>shell.py</code> file. This file exists to provide a front end for
      the language and to feed your code into the interpreter (in the
      <code>spindle.py</code> file) but is not necessary.
      <br />
    </p>
    <h3 id="runningAfileWithTheRunCommand">
      Running a file with the RUN("") command.
    </h3>
    <p>
      All Spindle code starts out as a string of text. The very first thing
      Spindle does is get it ready to run. This step of the process is called
      Semi-parsing and does three very critical things. <br />
      The first thing the semi-parser checks for is a RUN("") command. This is
      <strong
        >not</strong
      >
      apart of the college board standards but is necessary for the desktop
      experience. This is called a "command" because it is technically
      <em>outside</em>
      of the spindle language but included in the file. RUN() takes one
      parameter, which is the full name of the file that you would like to run
      (including all extensions) as a string. When you execute a RUN command,
      Spindle will look for a file with that name, and feed that code into the
      semi-parser. If there is no RUN command, this process is skipped and the
      code written directly in the terminal is ran instead. <br />
      <hr />
    </p>
    <h3 id="standardizingIfStatements">Standardizing IF statements</h3>
    <p>
      The second thing the semi-parser does is look at your program code and add
      "ELSE{}" to any of your if statements that do not have an else statement.
      It does this to fix a critical bug where an if statement without an else
      causes the program to
      <em>nullrun</em>, which is where spindle stops running code completely, or
      return a
      <em>fauxerror</em>, which is where spindle returns an error that simply
      doesn't make sense. <br />
      <hr />
    </p>
    <h3 id="divideAndConquerFunctions">Divide and Conquer Functions</h3>
    <p>
      The last, and most major thing the semi parser does is check whether your
      program has a function in it. If and only if your program has a function
      in it, the semi parser will chop your code into pieces in such a way that
      function definitions are isolated. Each piece will then be fed into
      Spindle. <br />
      <hr />
      In a sense:
    </p>
    <pre><code>PROCEDURE add(a,b) {
        IF (a == b) {
        RETURN
        }
        RETURN a + b
        }
        DISPLAY("hi")
        add(10,40)
        PROCEDURE sub(a,b) {
        RETURN a - b
        }
        sub(40,10)
        </code></pre>
    <p>Becomes (each code block is put into Spindle:</p>
    <pre><code>PROCEDURE add(a,b) {
        IF (a == b) {
        RETURN
        } ELSE{}
        RETURN a + b
        }
        </code></pre>
    <pre><code>DISPLAY("hi")
        add(10,40)
        </code></pre>
    <pre><code>PROCEDURE sub(a,b) {
        RETURN a - b
        }
        </code></pre>
    <pre><code>sub(40,10)
        </code></pre>
  <h2 id="addingMeaningToTokensTheParser">Adding meaning to tokens: The Parser</h2>
  <p>The parser adds meaning to your code by analysing the tokens generated by the lexer. While the lexer simply looks
    for &quot;IF&quot; and creates an &quot;IF&quot; token, the parser knows what an IF statement is, and in what order
    the tokens need to be in to make one. It denotes expressions, and so much more. As an example, it tells Spindle to
    handle a specific group of tokens as a for loop, and tells the interpreter to handle all the logic for it. The
    Interpreter is the next step after the lexer. Syntax checking is a lot more rigorous in the Parser, and this is
    where syntax errors usually come from. The Parser is the largest and most complicated part of Spindle, as it
    <em>literally</em> handles your program&#39;s logic. Because of its size and complexity, I will have to summarize it
    here. If you wish, you may expand upon this. </p>
  <p>It also tells Spindle what do to if it encounters a &quot;RETURN&quot; statement. <br>
    In a sense, it turns:
    <code>[INT:10,PLUS,INT:5]</code>
    Into [INT: 15].
